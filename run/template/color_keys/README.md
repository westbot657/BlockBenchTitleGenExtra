# Color Keys

This is a simple one-to-one input color to output color system.  
even-indexed columns (0, 2, 4, ...) are for colors that appear in the `flat.png` of a title texture, and colors that appear in your tile_maps folder  
odd-indexed columns (1, 3, 5, ...) are for the output color you want
