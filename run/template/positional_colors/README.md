# Positional Colors

Every file in this folder may only refer to 1 color key value  
the color you override must be in the top left, but can also fill the left side of the image  

the right side of the image can contain colors, colors cascade downward and do not interpolate when transitioning to a new color  

The image's height is stretched to fit the height of whatever text is being styled, so exact positioning is undetermined
